At BD or your internships, did you provide direct end-user support for software/hardware issues? If so, can you describe examples? I helped coworkers navigate complex filesystems on lab testing equipment.

Have you ever configured accounts, set up networks, or troubleshot Windows PCs, printers, or other peripherals? I have configured Microsoft accounts, set up Wi-Fi networks, and troubleshot printers and Windows PC's.

Can you quantify or describe instances where you tracked and resolved technical issues from start to finish, including follow-ups with users? Yes, I had a time when I assembled hardware and put together a PC from scratch for the AI business. Some issues I had to work through included selecting the correct CPU for the job (powerful but still affordable), assembling the fans in the right direction and not losing screws in the process, and inserting each of the various plugs into the correct ports. I also have had printer troubleshooting practice at my current job as a lab technician, as we use high-end Ricoh printers for our work which has powerful printing features.

Which experience shows your ability to work under pressure while handling multiple technical tasks or tickets simultaneously? I actually do work like that at my part-time job as a senior line cook, where I have to literally make recipes based on many simultaneous tickets, which, although not technical like an IT role, requires a lot of mental capicity and the ability to think under pressure.

Have you used tools like Microsoft 365, SCCM, or Active Directory in a support or troubleshooting capacity? Yes, I use Microsoft 365 tools every day at my job as an R&D Lab Technician (Outlook, Teams, Excel, Word, etc.)
