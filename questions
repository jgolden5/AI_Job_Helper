When supporting Ricoh printers and PCs in the lab, did you perform hands-on repairs (part replacement, hardware fixes), or was it mostly troubleshooting and escalation? It was mostly troubleshooting and escalation, but I have a high amount of troubleshooting skills and knowledge which range anywhere from software debugging to network troubleshooting.

Can you give me an example of a time you provided direct end-user or customer-facing technical support, either at BD, freelancing, or elsewhere? I helped coworkers navigate complex filesystems on lab testing equipment.

Have you ever had to document service calls, ticket resolutions, or asset changes in real time (similar to help desk systems), and if so, what tools did you use? Not in real-time, but as we went we kept an excel spreadsheet to update changes in medical devices, which I helped manage.

Do you have experience with on-site support tasks (like going to different physical locations, setting up equipment, or moving hardware), or has your support work mostly been remote/lab-based? Mostly in the lab, in-person.

Since this job mentions OEM certifications and basic repair toolkits, do you currently have any repair tools, certifications, or equivalent hands-on training that proves you can service laptops/desktops? I am working towards an AWS cloud certification.
